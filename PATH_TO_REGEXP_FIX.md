# Path-to-Regexp Error Fix

## Problem Identified
```
TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError
```

This error was caused by an incompatible route pattern in Express.js 5.x with the newer `path-to-regexp` version 8.2.0.

## Root Cause
The problematic code was:
```javascript
// 404 handler
this.app.use('*', (req, res) => {
  // ...
});
```

In Express 5.x, the `'*'` wildcard pattern is no longer valid with the updated `path-to-regexp` library.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Route Pattern
Changed from:
```javascript
this.app.use('*', (req, res) => {
```

To:
```javascript
this.app.use((req, res) => {
```

### Why This Works
- Removing the `'*'` pattern makes this a universal middleware that catches all unmatched routes
- This is the correct Express 5.x compatible approach for 404 handlers
- The functionality remains exactly the same - it still catches all unmatched routes

## Testing Results
âœ… **Server starts successfully**: `npm start`
âœ… **Watch mode works**: `npm run dev:watch` 
âœ… **Development mode works**: `npm run dev`
âœ… **All agents initialize**: 6/6 agents healthy
âœ… **All routes functional**: Health check and API endpoints working

## Related Fixes Previously Applied
1. **Node.js watch mode path resolution** - Fixed with proper ES module path handling
2. **Environment variable loading** - Added explicit dotenv configuration
3. **Error handling** - Added comprehensive exception handlers

## Express 5.x Compatibility Notes
- Express 5.x uses `path-to-regexp` v8.x which has stricter route pattern validation
- The `'*'` wildcard pattern is deprecated in favor of parameterless middleware
- Always test route patterns when upgrading Express versions

## Final Status
ðŸŽ‰ **All issues resolved** - The F1 Sequential Agents server now starts and runs correctly in all modes.
