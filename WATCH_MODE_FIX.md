# Server Watch Mode Fix

## Problem Fixed
The original error was:
```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "path" argument must be of type string. Received null
```

This occurred when using Node.js `--watch` flag due to path resolution issues with ES modules.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated server.js
- Added proper path resolution with `fileURLToPath` and `dirname`
- Added environment variable loading with explicit path
- Added comprehensive error handling for uncaught exceptions
- Added unhandled promise rejection handling

### 2. Updated package.json scripts
- `npm run dev` - Uses nodemon (most reliable for development)
- `npm run dev:watch` - Uses Node.js watch mode (now working)
- `npm run validate` - Tests all imports before starting
- `npm run start` - Production mode

### 3. Added validation script
- `validate-imports.js` - Tests all module imports
- Helps identify import issues before running watch mode

## Recommended Development Workflow

1. **For development**: Use `npm run dev` (nodemon)
2. **For Node.js watch**: Use `npm run dev:watch` (now fixed)
3. **For validation**: Use `npm run validate` before starting

## Root Cause
The original issue was caused by Node.js watch mode receiving null paths when:
- ES modules weren't properly configured for path resolution
- Environment variables weren't loaded early enough
- Error handling wasn't comprehensive enough

The fix ensures proper path resolution and error handling from the start.
